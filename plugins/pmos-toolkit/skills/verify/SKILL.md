# Implementation Verification Gate

Systematically verify that an implementation matches its spec, requirements, and plan. This is a **standalone verification gate** — run it anytime after implementation is done, regardless of how the code was written.

This is an **operational workflow** — a structured sequence of verification steps with evidence collection.

**Announce at start:** "Using the verify skill to run post-implementation verification."

## Platform Adaptation

These instructions use Claude Code tool names. In other environments:
- **No `AskUserQuestion`:** State your assumption, document it in the output, and proceed. The user reviews after completion.
- **No subagents:** Perform research and analysis sequentially as a single agent.
- **No Playwright MCP:** State the specific blocker and the setup the user must complete before browser-based verification can run. Do NOT mark any UI-surface FR verified without either Playwright evidence or an explicitly declared alternative (a specific test file that covers the rendered output). Offloading verification to the user is not a valid completion state — it resolves to `Unverified — action required` on the Phase 5 compliance tables, and Phase 4 stays open.
- **Task tracking:** Use your available task tracking tool (e.g., `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` in Claude Code, `update_plan` in Codex, or equivalent). If none is available, announce phase transitions verbally.

---

## Backlog Bridge

This skill optionally integrates with `/backlog`. See `plugins/pmos-toolkit/skills/backlog/pipeline-bridge.md`.

**At skill start:**
- If `--backlog <id>` was passed: load the item file as supplementary context.

**At skill end (only if the verify pass is reported successful):**
- If `<id>` was set, invoke `/backlog set {id} status=done`. If the active branch has an associated PR (detect via `gh pr view --json url`), also invoke `/backlog set {id} pr={url}`. On failure, warn and continue.
- Run the auto-capture flow per `pipeline-bridge.md`: scan the verify output for "Known issues" / "Follow-up" sections and propose new backlog items.

---

**Create verification tasks** at the start using your available task tracking tool:

1. Gather Context
2. Static Verification (lint, types, tests)
3. Code Quality Review
4. Deploy & Integration Verification
5. Spec Compliance Check
6. Harden Test Suite
7. Final Compliance Pass
8. Commit & Report

Mark each as in-progress when starting and completed when done. Skip tasks that don't apply (e.g., skip deploy if no deployment is involved).

---

## When to Use

- After `/execute` completes (double-check)
- After manual implementation
- After picking up someone else's partial work
- Before claiming a feature is done
- When you suspect gaps between spec and implementation

---

## Phase 0: Load Workstream Context

Before any other work, follow the context loading instructions in `product-context/context-loading.md` (relative to the skills directory). This determines `{docs_path}` and loads workstream context if available. Use workstream context to verify that implementation aligns with product goals, not just spec compliance. Also read `~/.pmos/learnings.md` if it exists. Note any entries under `## /verify` and factor them into your approach for this session.

**Resolve feature folder.** Follow `../_shared/feature-folder.md` with `skill_name=verify`, `feature_arg=<--feature value or empty>`, and `feature_hint=<topic if provided>`. Use the returned folder path as `{feature_folder}`. This skill reads all prior artifacts (`01_requirements.md`, `02_spec.md`, `03_plan.md`, `execute/`) and writes review reports under `{feature_folder}/verify/`.

---

## Phase 1: Gather Context

1. **Locate upstream documents.** Resolve each of the three inputs by following `../.shared/resolve-input.md`:
   - Spec: `phase=spec`, `label="spec"` (user argument, if passed, applies to the spec)
   - Requirements: `phase=requirements`, `label="requirements doc"`
   - Plan: `phase=plan`, `label="plan"`
2. **Read all three documents** (whichever exist). You need these for the compliance check.
3. **Identify what changed.** Run `git diff main...HEAD --stat` (or appropriate base) to see which files were modified. This scopes the verification.
4. **Check if lint/type/tests were already run.** Ask the user or check recent terminal history. Skip steps already completed — but re-run if you're not confident they were clean.

---

## Phase 2: Static Verification (fast, run first)

Run in this order. Each step must pass before proceeding to the next. If a step fails, fix the issue, then re-run.

### 1a. Lint & Format

```bash
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
```
(Or project-appropriate linter. Check `CLAUDE.md` for the correct commands.)

**If issues found:** Fix them. Re-run. Do not proceed until clean.

### 1b. Type Checks

```bash
# Python: pyright or mypy
# TypeScript: tsc --noEmit
# Frontend: npm run lint (if it includes type checking)
```

**If issues found:** Fix them. Re-run.

### 1c. Unit Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v  # or project-appropriate test command
```

**Evidence required:** Paste the summary line showing pass/fail counts. "X passed, 0 failed" is the minimum bar.

**If failures:** Fix them. Do NOT skip failing tests. Do NOT mark tests as `@pytest.mark.skip` to make the suite pass.

### 1d. Frontend Tests & Lint (if applicable)

```bash
cd apps/<frontend-app> && npm run lint && npm test
```

---

## Phase 3: Multi-Agent Code Quality Review

Dispatch parallel subagents to review the diff from multiple angles. This catches code quality issues that static analysis and tests miss. Works against `git diff` — no PR required.

### Setup

```bash
# Get the diff to review
git diff main...HEAD          # if on a feature branch
git diff HEAD~N               # if commits are on main (N = number of commits in this feature)
```

Identify all CLAUDE.md files relevant to the changed directories (root + any directory-level CLAUDE.md files).

### Parallel Review Agents (dispatch simultaneously)

Launch 3-5 subagents depending on the scope of changes:

| Agent | Focus | What to return |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **CLAUDE.md compliance** | Read the diff + all relevant CLAUDE.md files. Flag any violations of project conventions, naming patterns, code style rules, or architectural constraints. | List of violations with file:line and the specific CLAUDE.md rule. |
| **Bug scan** | Read only the changed lines (shallow scan). Look for obvious bugs: off-by-one errors, null/undefined access, missing error handling at system boundaries, race conditions, resource leaks. Ignore style issues. | List of potential bugs with severity and reasoning. |
| **Git history context** | Run `git blame` and `git log` on modified files. Check if changes break assumptions from previous work — renamed functions still referenced elsewhere, removed code that other modules depend on, changed behavior that tests don't cover. | List of issues with historical context. |
| **Comment compliance** | Read code comments in modified files (TODOs, invariants, "do not change" warnings, API contracts documented in docstrings). Check if the changes violate any guidance in those comments. | List of violated comments with file:line. |
| **Cross-file consistency** | Check that changes are consistent across files — if a function signature changed, are all callers updated? If a type changed, are all usages updated? If a config key was renamed, is it renamed everywhere? | List of inconsistencies. |

### Confidence Scoring

For each issue found, score confidence (0-100):

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0-25 | Likely false positive — doesn't stand up to scrutiny, or pre-existing issue |
| 25-50 | Might be real but could be a nitpick. Not explicitly called out in CLAUDE.md. |
| 50-75 | Verified real issue but minor — won't happen often in practice |
| 75-100 | Verified real issue, will directly impact functionality, or explicitly violates CLAUDE.md |

**Filter:** Only act on issues scoring 75+. Log issues scoring 50-74 as "noted but not blocking." Discard below 50.

### Fix & Re-verify

For each issue scoring 75+:
1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run the relevant static verification step from Phase 1
3. If the fix changes behavior, add a regression test (Phase 5)

---

## Phase 4: Deploy & Integration Verification

### Phase 4 Entry Gate — Enumerate the Verification Surface

Before running any Phase 4 sub-step, enumerate every upstream requirement that has a runtime surface and create one `TodoWrite` task per item. This list is the gate — Phase 4 is not complete until every todo is closed with evidence or explicitly resolved to `Unverified — action required` with a named blocker. A plain bullet list in prose does not substitute for `TodoWrite` todos; the todos are the structural enforcement.

**How to build the list:**

1. Read the spec's FR-IDs and edge cases. For each, classify the runtime surface:
   - **UI surface** (user sees, clicks, enters something) → todo required
   - **API surface** (new or modified endpoint) → todo required
   - **Data surface** (migration, schema change, background job output) → todo required
   - **Pure internal logic** (algorithm verified by unit test only) → NOT on the list; cite the test in Phase 5 compliance instead
2. Read the requirements doc's user journeys. Every end-to-end journey with UI or API touchpoints gets one todo.
3. For each enumerated item, create a `TodoWrite` task formatted as:
   `Verify <FR-ID or Journey-ID>: <one-line description> [evidence: <type from table below>]`

**Evidence-type allowlist by sub-step:**

| Sub-step | Acceptable evidence |
|----------|--------------------|
| 3a. Database Migrations | Migration command output + DB schema query confirming the new shape |
| 3b. Docker Deployment | Service health check output + startup log snippet showing no errors |
| 3c. API Smoke Tests | `curl` response body compared row-by-row to the spec's API contract |
| 3d. Frontend Verification | Playwright MCP screenshot, `browser_evaluate` DOM assertion, or a specific test file covering the rendered output |
| 3e. Interactive Spot Checks | Playwright MCP interaction trace covering a user journey end-to-end, including at least one error/edge path |

**Every enumerated todo resolves to exactly one of three outcomes:**

1. **Verified** — evidence produced and cited. The evidence type must match the allowlist row for the sub-step. Close the todo.
2. **NA — alternative evidence cited** — the runtime surface doesn't exist for this item (e.g., FR is a pure calculation change). Cite the alternative (e.g., `test_pricing.py::test_discount_applied`) or the specific reason tied to the FR text. Bare "NA" is not valid. Close the todo with the alternative recorded.
3. **Unverified — action required** — you attempted verification and were blocked. State the specific blocker and the user action needed (e.g., "user must run `make seed-dev-db` before 3e can proceed"). Leave the todo OPEN and surface it in the Phase 8 final report.

**Setup is part of Phase 4, not a prerequisite.** Starting the dev server, seeding the DB, running migrations, authenticating — all Phase 4 work. If setup is complex, write down the exact commands, execute them, and proceed. Only escalate to the user when a genuine decision is required (e.g., "which dev DB to use"), not to offload execution. "Setup would take too long" is a Phase 4 red flag, not a reason.

### Phase 4 Red Flags — rationalizations that mean you're about to skip

If any of these thoughts surface during Phase 4, stop and re-read the entry gate. Each is a rationalization the skill has seen and named:

| Thought | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "Automated tests already pass — good enough" | Automated tests miss UX, rendering, timing, and copy issues. The entry gate still applies. Every enumerated todo still needs evidence. |
| "This is out of scope for /verify" | Phase 4 is a numbered phase in this skill. Verification cannot be out of scope for the verification skill. |
| "The user can verify this at their desk" | Playwright MCP, `curl`, and DB queries are agent-owned tools. Offloading interactive verification to the user resolves to `Unverified — action required`, not `Verified`. |
| "Setup would take too long" | Setup is Phase 4 work. If you have time to write the final report, you have time to start the server. |
| "The happy path worked; good enough" | The spec's edge cases are explicit. Test at least one error/edge path per affected flow — the entry gate names this in 3e's evidence row. |
| "I'll note it as a gap" | A gap you could have verified but didn't is not a gap — it's a skip. Either produce evidence (close as Verified), cite alternative evidence (close as NA), or name the blocker (leave open as Unverified-action-required). There is no fourth state. |

### 3a. Database Migrations (if applicable)

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Verify the migration applied cleanly. Check for errors in output.

### 3b. Docker Deployment

Deploy to the appropriate environment (main stack or worktree stack):

```bash
docker compose build <affected-services> && docker compose up -d <affected-services>
```

Wait for services to be healthy. Check logs for startup errors.

### 3c. API Smoke Tests

For every new or modified API endpoint, verify the response shape matches the spec:

```bash
curl -sf <endpoint> | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Evidence required:** Show the actual response and compare it to the spec's API contract. Flag any mismatches.

### 3d. Frontend Verification (Playwright MCP)

For every affected UI flow:

1. **Authenticate first** (if auth is enabled)
2. **Navigate** to each affected page
3. **Walk through** every user journey from the spec
4. **Check** for console errors/warnings
5. **Take screenshots** for evidence
6. **Verify** that UI matches spec's frontend design section

### 3e. Interactive Spot Checks

Run actual scenarios in the development environment. Interact with the system as a user would. Specifically:

- Test the happy path end-to-end
- Test at least one error/edge case from the spec
- Test empty states if applicable
- Verify that unrelated flows still work (no regressions)

**Do NOT rely only on automated tests.** Interactive verification (Playwright MCP driving real user journeys) catches issues that tests miss: rendering glitches, confusing UX, wrong copy, timing issues. "Interactive" means you operate the browser via MCP — not that a human operates it for you.

---

## Phase 5: Spec Compliance Check

This is the most important phase. Re-read each upstream document and verify every requirement is implemented.

**Three-state outcome model (applies to 4a, 4b, 4c):**

Every row in every compliance table resolves to exactly one of three outcomes. Bare "Pass", "Fail", "Complete", or "Partial" are not valid — they collapse into the three below, and every row's `Evidence` column must cite a concrete artifact.

| Outcome | Meaning | Required in Evidence column |
|---------|---------|----------------------------|
| **Verified** | Requirement/task met; evidence produced during Phase 2–4. | Test file + function, screenshot path, `curl` output excerpt, DB query result, or commit SHA. The evidence type must match what was declared in the Phase 4 entry gate allowlist if the row has a runtime surface. |
| **NA (alt-evidence)** | No runtime surface for this row, OR the row was intentionally out of scope and covered indirectly. | Named alternative: e.g., "covered by `test_pricing.py::test_discount_applied`", or the specific reason tied to the requirement text (e.g., "FR narrative change only — no code path"). Bare "NA" or "N/A" is not valid. |
| **Unverified — action required** | Verification was attempted and blocked. The row is NOT resolved. | The specific blocker and the user action needed to unblock (e.g., "Playwright MCP unavailable in this environment — user must install; re-run 3d after"). Unverified rows must also appear in the Phase 8 final report as open items. |

Every row also cross-references the todo it closed (or left open) from the Phase 4 entry gate, if applicable. If no Phase 4 todo was created (pure internal logic), the Evidence column names the unit test that covered it.

### 4a. Requirements Compliance

Read `{feature_folder}/01_requirements.md` (resolved in Phase 1). For every goal, user journey, and acceptance criterion:

| # | Requirement | Outcome | Evidence |
|---|-------------|---------|----------|
| Goal 1 | [From requirements] | Verified / NA / Unverified | [Per the three-state model: test file, screenshot path, curl excerpt, DB query, alt-evidence citation, or blocker + user action] |
| Journey 1, Step 3 | [Specific step] | Verified / NA / Unverified | [e.g., `screenshots/j1-s3.png` from Phase 4 3d, or `Unverified — dev server wouldn't start; user must run docker compose up`] |

### 4b. Spec Compliance

Read `{feature_folder}/02_spec.md` (resolved in Phase 1). For every FR-ID and edge case:

| ID | Requirement | Outcome | Evidence |
|----|-------------|---------|----------|
| FR-01 | [From spec] | Verified / NA / Unverified | [Per the three-state model — e.g., `test_orders.py::test_checkout_flow`, or `screenshots/fr-01-checkout.png`, or `Unverified — Stripe webhook endpoint requires live deploy`] |
| FR-02 | ... | ... | ... |
| E1 | [Edge case] | Verified / NA / Unverified | [Evidence for the edge case specifically, not the happy path] |

### 4c. Plan Compliance

Read `{feature_folder}/03_plan.md` (resolved in Phase 1). For every task:

| Task | Outcome | Evidence |
|------|---------|----------|
| T1: [Name] | Verified-complete / NA-skipped-with-reason / Unverified | [Commit SHA(s) implementing the task + at least one test or Phase 4 verification artifact; OR the decision record for an intentional skip (e.g., "merged into T3 during execution"); OR the blocker + user action] |
| T2: ... | ... | ... |

**For plan-task outcomes:**
- `Verified-complete` requires BOTH a commit reference AND a verification artifact (test, screenshot, curl excerpt). A commit alone is not evidence of correctness — only of existence.
- `NA-skipped-with-reason` requires naming the decision AND where it was recorded (plan update, session log, commit message). "NA" without a reason is not valid.
- `Unverified` means the task was claimed done but the verification couldn't be produced. This is a gap — surface it in the 4d Gap Report.

### 4d. Gap Report

List every gap found:

| # | Gap | Severity | Source Doc | Action |
|---|-----|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | [What's missing] | Critical/Medium/Low | [Which doc] | [Fix or defer] |

**If critical gaps exist:** Fix them before proceeding. Re-run affected verification steps.

---

## Phase 6: Harden the Test Suite

For every issue discovered during verification:

1. **Write a regression test** that would have caught the issue
2. **Verify red-green:** The test must fail when you revert the fix, and pass with the fix applied
3. **Name descriptively:** `test_<function>_<bug_condition>_<expected_outcome>`

This is not optional. The goal is that the same issue can never ship again.

Also check for coverage gaps:
- Any spec requirement with no corresponding test? Write one.
- Any edge case from the spec that isn't tested? Write one.
- Any user journey that's only verified manually? Consider adding an integration or E2E test.

---

## Phase 7: Final Compliance Pass

One last check before committing:

1. **Re-read the spec one final time.** Is there ANYTHING mentioned that isn't implemented or verified?
2. **Check for TODO/FIXME/HACK** in the changed files. Resolve them or flag them explicitly.
3. **Check for debug logging** or temporary code that should be removed.
4. **Check for hardcoded values** that should be configuration.
5. **Verify documentation is updated** (CLAUDE.md, changelogs, API docs).

---

## Phase 8: Commit & Report

1. **Commit all changes** (fixes, new tests, documentation updates):
   ```bash
   git add <specific-files>
   git commit -m "fix: verification fixes for <feature>"
   ```
   If there are multiple logical changes, use multiple commits.

2. **Write the review report** to `{feature_folder}/verify/{YYYY-MM-DD}-review.md`. If a report with that name already exists from an earlier run today, append `-2`, `-3`, etc. (e.g., `2026-04-30-review-2.md`). The report contains the same content delivered to the user in step 3.

3. **Report to the user:**
   - Verification summary (which phases passed/failed)
   - Compliance tables (requirements, spec FR-IDs, plan tasks)
   - Gaps found and how they were resolved
   - New tests added (count and what they cover)
   - Any remaining issues that need user decision

---

## Phase 9: Workstream Enrichment

**Skip if no workstream was loaded in Phase 0.** Otherwise, follow the enrichment instructions in `product-context/context-loading.md` Step 4. For this skill, the signals to look for are:

- Implementation gaps discovered vs spec → workstream `## Key Decisions`
- New constraints or scars uncovered during verification → workstream `## Constraints & Scars`

This phase is mandatory whenever Phase 0 loaded a workstream — do not skip it just because the core deliverable is complete.

---

## Phase 10: Capture Learnings

**This skill is not complete until the learnings-capture process has run.** Read and follow `learnings/learnings-capture.md` (relative to the skills directory) now. Reflect on whether this session surfaced anything worth capturing — surprising behaviors, repeated corrections, non-obvious decisions. Proposing zero learnings is a valid outcome for a smooth session; the gate is that the reflection happens, not that an entry is written.

---

## Evidence Standards

Every claim must have evidence. No exceptions:

| Claim | Required Evidence |
|-------|------------------|
| "Tests pass" | Paste the actual output: "34 passed, 0 failed" |
| "Lint is clean" | Paste the actual output: no errors |
| "API returns correct shape" | Show the actual curl output |
| "UI renders correctly" | Screenshot via Playwright MCP |
| "Spec requirement met" | Point to specific test or interactive verification artifact |
| "No regressions" | Show full test suite output |

**Never use:** "should pass", "looks correct", "probably fine", "I believe"

---

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

For Phase 4 skip rationalizations specifically, see the **Phase 4 Red Flags** table — those six thoughts are the most common skips and are named individually there. This section covers general-purpose anti-patterns that apply across phases.

- Do NOT mark failing tests as skip to make the suite pass
- Do NOT claim "tests pass" without showing the output
- Do NOT skip the Phase 5 spec compliance check — this is the most valuable phase
- Do NOT leave discovered issues as "known gaps" — every item resolves to one of the three Phase 5 states (Verified, NA-with-alt-evidence, or Unverified-action-required with a named blocker). There is no fourth state.
- Do NOT commit debug logging, TODOs, or temporary workarounds
- Do NOT verify only the happy path — every affected flow gets at least one error/edge case per the Phase 4 entry gate's 3e evidence row
- Do NOT assume the previous verification run is still valid — re-run after every fix
- Do NOT skip the Phase 6 hardening phase — converting bugs to tests is what prevents regressions
