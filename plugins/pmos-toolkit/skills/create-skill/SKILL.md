# Create Skill

Lightweight wrapper around `/skill-creator:skill-creator` that adds project-specific conventions: save location, cross-platform adaptation, description quality, and pipeline integration.

**Announce at start:** "Using create-skill to set up a new skill with cross-platform conventions."

## Before You Start

Invoke `/skill-creator:skill-creator` for the full skill creation workflow (intent capture, interview, drafting, test cases, evaluation loop). This skill adds conventions on top of that process — it does NOT replace it.

---

## Convention 1: Save Location

The repo has two skill directories:

- **`skills/`** — Skills created by the user (pipeline, utilities, custom workflows)
- **`plugins/`** — Skills from external plugins (e.g., impeccable design ecosystem)

New user-created skills go in:

```
~/Desktop/Projects/agent-skills/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

The `<skill-name>` directory should be lowercase, hyphenated (e.g., `create-skill`, `msf`, `verify`). Check both directories for name collisions:

```bash
ls ~/Desktop/Projects/agent-skills/skills/ ~/Desktop/Projects/agent-skills/plugins/
```

Skills in `skills/` are delivered via the `pmos-toolkit` plugin (namespace: `pmos-toolkit:<skill-name>`). No symlink step needed — the plugin system discovers them automatically. Just restart your session or run `/reload-plugins`.

---

## Convention 2: Cross-Platform Adaptation

Every skill MUST include this section after the "Announce at start" line:

```markdown
## Platform Adaptation

These instructions use Claude Code tool names. In other environments:
- **No `AskUserQuestion`:** State your assumption, document it in the output, and proceed. The user reviews after completion.
- **No subagents:** Perform research and analysis sequentially as a single agent.
- **No Playwright MCP:** Note browser-based verification as a manual step for the user.
```

Additionally, when writing skill instructions:
- Do NOT make `AskUserQuestion` the only way to get user input — always provide a "proceed with stated assumptions" fallback
- Do NOT delegate core logic to external plugins — include enough inline instructions that the skill works standalone
- Do NOT assume MCP tools are available — treat them as optional enhancements
- Do NOT assume subagent dispatch — write instructions that work sequentially too

---

## Convention 3: Description Quality

The `description:` field in frontmatter must include:

1. **What it does** (1 sentence)
2. **Pipeline position** if it fits in the requirements→spec→plan→execute→verify pipeline
3. **Natural trigger phrases** — common things users say that should invoke this skill

Example of a good description:
```
description: Create a detailed technical specification from a requirements document — architecture, API contracts, DB schema, frontend design, testing strategy, verification plan. Second stage in the requirements -> spec -> plan pipeline. Auto-tiers by scope. Use when the user says "write the technical design", "design the system", "create the spec", or has a requirements doc ready for detailed design.
```

The trigger phrases matter because skill descriptions are how the agent decides whether to invoke a skill. Without natural-language triggers, users have to remember the exact slash command name.

---

## Convention 4: Pipeline Awareness

If the new skill fits into the existing pipeline, include the full pipeline diagram:

```markdown
/requirements  →  [/msf, /creativity]  →  /spec  →  /plan  →  /execute  →  /verify
                   optional enhancers
```

Mark the new skill's position with `(this skill)`. If it's an optional enhancer, show it in the brackets. If it's standalone (like `/verify`), note that in the description.

---

## Convention 5: Standard Frontmatter

Every skill must have at minimum:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: <what + when — see Convention 3>
user-invocable: true
argument-hint: "<what to pass>"
---
```

## Checklist Before Saving

Before writing the final SKILL.md, verify:

- [ ] Saved to `~/Desktop/Projects/agent-skills/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` (NOT `plugins/`)
- [ ] Restarted session or ran `/reload-plugins` to pick up the new skill
- [ ] Platform Adaptation section present
- [ ] Description includes natural trigger phrases
- [ ] No hard dependency on external plugins (fully self-contained)
- [ ] No hard dependency on `AskUserQuestion` (assumption fallback exists)
- [ ] No hard dependency on MCP tools (noted as manual step if unavailable)
- [ ] Pipeline diagram included if the skill fits the pipeline
- [ ] Under 500 lines (extract to `reference/` files if needed)
