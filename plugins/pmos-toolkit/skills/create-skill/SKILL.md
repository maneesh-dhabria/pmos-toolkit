# Create Skill

Lightweight wrapper around `/skill-creator:skill-creator` that adds project-specific conventions: save location, cross-platform adaptation, description quality, and pipeline integration.

**Announce at start:** "Using create-skill to set up a new skill with cross-platform conventions."

## Before You Start

Invoke `/skill-creator:skill-creator` for the full skill creation workflow (intent capture, interview, drafting, test cases, evaluation loop). This skill adds conventions on top of that process — it does NOT replace it.

---

## Convention 1: Save Location

The repo has two skill directories:

- **`skills/`** — Skills created by the user (pipeline, utilities, custom workflows)
- **`plugins/`** — Skills from external plugins (e.g., impeccable design ecosystem)

New user-created skills go in:

```
~/Desktop/Projects/agent-skills/skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md
```

The `<skill-name>` directory should be lowercase, hyphenated (e.g., `create-skill`, `msf`, `verify`). Check both directories for name collisions:

```bash
ls ~/Desktop/Projects/agent-skills/skills/ ~/Desktop/Projects/agent-skills/plugins/
```

Skills in `skills/` are delivered via the `pmos-toolkit` plugin (namespace: `pmos-toolkit:<skill-name>`). No symlink step needed — the plugin system discovers them automatically. Just restart your session or run `/reload-plugins`.

---

## Convention 2: Cross-Platform Adaptation

Every skill MUST include this section after the "Announce at start" line:

```markdown
## Platform Adaptation

These instructions use Claude Code tool names. In other environments:
- **No `AskUserQuestion`:** State your assumption, document it in the output, and proceed. The user reviews after completion.
- **No subagents:** Perform research and analysis sequentially as a single agent.
- **No Playwright MCP:** Note browser-based verification as a manual step for the user.
```

Additionally, when writing skill instructions:
- Do NOT make `AskUserQuestion` the only way to get user input — always provide a "proceed with stated assumptions" fallback
- Do NOT delegate core logic to external plugins — include enough inline instructions that the skill works standalone
- Do NOT assume MCP tools are available — treat them as optional enhancements
- Do NOT assume subagent dispatch — write instructions that work sequentially too

**Self-contained skills should inline these patterns where applicable:**
- **Setup** — environment preparation, dependency detection, workspace isolation
- **Self-review & refinement loops** — review own output against requirements, iterate until quality bar is met (minimum 2 loops)
- **Escalation policy** — when to stop and ask for help vs. proceeding with stated assumptions
- **Evidence standards** — what constitutes proof that a step succeeded (command output, not "should work")

---

## Convention 3: Description Quality

The `description:` field in frontmatter must include:

1. **What it does** (1 sentence)
2. **Pipeline position** if it fits in the requirements→spec→plan→execute→verify pipeline
3. **Natural trigger phrases** — common things users say that should invoke this skill

Example of a good description:
```
description: Create a detailed technical specification from a requirements document — architecture, API contracts, DB schema, frontend design, testing strategy, verification plan. Second stage in the requirements -> spec -> plan pipeline. Auto-tiers by scope. Use when the user says "write the technical design", "design the system", "create the spec", or has a requirements doc ready for detailed design.
```

The trigger phrases matter because skill descriptions are how the agent decides whether to invoke a skill. Without natural-language triggers, users have to remember the exact slash command name.

---

## Convention 4: Pipeline Awareness

If the new skill fits into the existing pipeline, include the full pipeline diagram:

```markdown
/requirements  →  [/msf, /creativity]  →  /spec  →  /plan  →  /execute  →  /verify
                   optional enhancers
```

Mark the new skill's position with `(this skill)`. If it's an optional enhancer, show it in the brackets. If it's standalone (like `/verify`), note that in the description.

---

## Convention 5: Standard Frontmatter

Every skill must have at minimum:

```yaml
---
name: <skill-name>
description: <what + when — see Convention 3>
user-invocable: true
argument-hint: "<what to pass>"
---
```

---

## Convention 6: Learning Integration

Every pipeline skill MUST include two learning integration points:

**At startup** (in Phase 0 or as a standalone section after Platform Adaptation):

```markdown
Read `~/.pmos/learnings.md` if it exists. Note any entries under `## /skill-name` and factor them into your approach for this session.
```

**At end** (after the skill's core work and workstream enrichment, before Anti-Patterns):

```markdown
## Capture Learnings (after workstream enrichment)

Follow the learning capture instructions in `learnings/learnings-capture.md` (relative to the skills directory).
```

This ensures new skills participate in the global feedback loop from day one.

---

## Convention 7: Progress Tracking for Multi-Phase Skills

If the skill has **3 or more sequential phases, steps, or user-approval gates**, include a progress-tracking instruction near the top (after Platform Adaptation). Single-shot skills (e.g., `/commit`, `/changelog`) should skip this — the overhead clutters them.

Use platform-neutral phrasing so the instruction works across Claude Code, Codex, and other agents:

```markdown
## Track Progress

This skill has multiple phases. Create one task per phase using your agent's task-tracking tool (e.g., `TodoWrite` in Claude Code, equivalent in other agents). Mark each task in-progress when you start it and completed as soon as it finishes — do not batch completions.
```

Rule of thumb: if a user reading the skill would benefit from seeing which phase you're in, add the tracking instruction. Otherwise don't.
