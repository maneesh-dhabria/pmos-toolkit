# Plan Executor

Execute an implementation plan end-to-end with strict verification. Supports git worktree isolation when available, but works without it.

Follow the inline instructions below — they are self-contained.

**Announce at start:** "Using the execute skill to implement the plan in an isolated worktree."

## Platform Adaptation

These instructions use Claude Code tool names. In other environments:
- **No `AskUserQuestion`:** State your assumption, document it in the output, and proceed. The user reviews after completion.
- **No subagents:** Perform research and analysis sequentially as a single agent.
- **No Playwright MCP:** Note browser-based verification as a manual step for the user.
- **Task tracking:** Use your available task tracking tool (e.g., `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate` in Claude Code, `update_plan` in Codex, or equivalent). If none is available, track progress via commit messages and report status verbally.

---

## Phase 0: Setup

1. **Locate the plan.** If the user passed an argument, use it. Otherwise check `docs/plans/` for the most recent file. If nothing found, ask.
2. **Read the plan and its upstream spec end-to-end.** Understand the "Done when" criteria and final verification task.
3. **Isolate the work:**
   - **Worktree (preferred):** Check for existing `.worktrees/` or `worktrees/` directory. If neither exists, create `.worktrees/`. Verify the directory is gitignored (`git check-ignore -q .worktrees`); if not, add it to `.gitignore` and commit. Then:
     ```bash
     git worktree add .worktrees/<branch-name> -b <branch-name>
     cd .worktrees/<branch-name>
     ```
   - **Fallback:** `git checkout -b feature/<name>` if worktrees aren't practical.
   - **Setup:** Auto-detect and install dependencies (`npm install`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, `cargo build`, etc.). Run the test suite to establish a clean baseline before starting work.
4. **Check for environment conflicts.** If using Docker with parallel stacks, ensure ports and project names don't collide.
5. **Verify verification tooling.** Before starting Task 1, confirm that every verification tool the plan requires is responsive:
   - If the plan has backend API tasks: confirm the dev server starts and responds to a basic request.
   - If the plan has frontend tasks: confirm browser automation (Playwright MCP) is responsive. If it fails, establish the fallback now (build check, type check, curl against dev server) — do NOT proceed assuming it will work later.
   - If any tool is unavailable, log it and document the alternative before starting.
6. **Create task list.** Extract every task from the plan and create a tracked task for each, using your available task tracking tool. Include:
   - Task name and number from the plan
   - Key files to be modified
   - Dependencies on other tasks (if any)
   - The task's verification criteria as its "done" signal

   This gives the user (and you) a live progress view throughout execution.

## Phase 1: Execute Tasks

Work through the plan's tasks in order. For each task:

1. **Mark task as in-progress** in your task tracker.
2. **Read the task** — understand goal, files, spec refs, and steps.
3. **Follow TDD** — write failing test, verify it fails, implement, verify it passes.
4. **Run the verify-fix loop** (see below).
5. **Commit** — small, focused commit per task. Not one giant commit at the end.
6. **Mark task as completed** in your task tracker.
7. **Move to next task** — only after verification passes and task is marked complete.

### Verify-Fix Loop (per task)

Do not move to the next task until the current task's verification passes. This is a bounded loop, not a hope:

```
attempt = 0
while verification fails AND attempt < 3:
    1. Read the failure output carefully
    2. Diagnose root cause (not symptoms)
    3. Fix
    4. Re-run the FULL verification (not just the part that failed)
    attempt += 1

if still failing after 3 attempts:
    STOP — escalate to user with:
    - What the task requires
    - What verification command fails
    - What you tried and why it didn't work
    - Your best guess at the underlying issue
```

**Rules:**
- Each retry must change something — never re-run the same code hoping for a different result.
- Re-run the full task verification, not just the failing subset. A fix in one place can break another.
- The bound (3 attempts) prevents thrashing. If you can't fix it in 3 tries, a human needs to look.

### Subagent Execution (when Agent tool is available)

Dispatch a fresh subagent per task. Fresh context prevents confusion from accumulated state. After each task, run a **two-stage review**:

1. **Spec compliance review** — dispatch a reviewer subagent with the task's spec requirements and the implementer's diff. Question: does the code match the spec? Flag missing requirements or scope creep.
2. **Code quality review** — dispatch a second reviewer with the diff and project conventions (CLAUDE.md). Question: is the code well-built? Flag bugs, inconsistencies, convention violations.

If either reviewer finds issues, the implementer fixes them and the reviewer re-reviews. Do not proceed to the next task with open issues.

**Handling implementer status:**
- **Done** — proceed to review.
- **Needs context** — provide the missing information and re-dispatch.
- **Blocked** — assess: provide more context, use a more capable model, break the task smaller, or escalate to the user. Never retry without changing something.

### Sequential Execution (no subagents)

Execute tasks in order. After each task, self-review against the spec before proceeding.

### Execution Rules

- **Test in smaller chunks.** Verify after each task. Do NOT batch all testing to the end.
- **Runtime verification for API tasks.** For tasks that modify API endpoints or middleware, inline verification MUST include a runtime check (`curl` or equivalent against a running dev server) — not just passing tests. Tests verify code correctness; runtime checks verify DI wiring, middleware, serialization, and actual DB state.
- **Update documentation** as part of relevant tasks (CLAUDE.md, changelogs, etc.).
- **Log plan deviations.** When the actual codebase differs from what the plan assumes (e.g., model fields don't exist, method signatures differ, enum values are different), log it inline: `DEVIATION: Plan assumes X, actual codebase has Y`. Adapt the implementation to reality but do NOT silently adjust — the deviation log helps catch plan quality issues for future sessions.

---

## Phase 2: Deploy & Verify

After all tasks are complete, run the plan's final verification task. If the plan doesn't have one, construct it from this checklist:

### Verification Checklist

Run every applicable item. Do NOT skip verification steps. Do NOT rely solely on tests passing.

- [ ] **Lint & format:** `ruff check . && ruff format --check .`
- [ ] **Full test suite:** `pytest` — expect no regressions
- [ ] **Database migrations:** `alembic upgrade head` (if migrations added)
- [ ] **Docker deploy to worktree stack:**
  ```bash
  cd .worktrees/<branch>
  docker compose -f docker-compose.worktree.yml -p <project> up --build -d
  ```
  Ensure port offsets don't collide with other running stacks.
- [ ] **API verification:** Use `curl` or CLI commands to verify every new/modified endpoint returns the expected payload shape as defined in the spec.
- [ ] **Frontend verification** (fallback ladder — use the first level that works):
  1. **Playwright MCP** (preferred): authenticate, navigate to each affected page, walk through every user journey from the spec, check for console errors, take screenshots.
  2. **If Playwright fails**: attempt recovery once (clear cache, new tab). If still dead, move to level 3.
  3. **Programmatic fallback**: `curl` the dev server routes (expect 200), verify the JS bundle contains expected component imports (`curl <bundle-url> | grep`), run type checks (`vue-tsc`, `tsc --noEmit`) and build (`npm run build`).
  4. **Suggest tooling fix**: propose concrete commands to restore browser testing. Do NOT ask the user to manually test features — that defeats the purpose of automated verification.

  Never skip frontend verification entirely. Never fall back to "please check manually."
- [ ] **Manual spot check:** Run actual scenarios in the development environment. Verify functionality by interacting with the system as a user would. Do NOT only rely on automated tests.
- [ ] **Seed data:** Re-seed if data files changed: `python scripts/seed_sop_db.py --reset`

### Verification Failures

When verification reveals issues:
1. Fix the issue
2. Add a test that would have caught it (expand the automated test suite)
3. Re-run the relevant verification steps
4. Continue until all checks pass

---

## Phase 3: Spec Compliance Review

After verification passes, do a final compliance check:

1. **Re-read the spec.** Go through every section and FR-ID. Confirm each requirement is implemented and verified.
2. **Re-read the plan.** Check every task's "Done when" criteria. Confirm nothing was skipped.
3. **List any gaps** between the spec/plan and the final implementation. If gaps exist, fix them before proceeding.

---

## Phase 4: Commit & Report

1. **Commit all changes** with a clear commit message referencing the plan.
2. **Report to the user:**
   - What was implemented (task summary)
   - Verification results (which checks passed)
   - Any gaps found and how they were resolved
   - Any new tests added from discovered issues
   - Worktree location and Docker stack status

Do NOT tear down the worktree stack — the user may want to inspect it. Remind them to clean up when done:
```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.worktree.yml -p <project> down
```

---

## Evidence Before Claims

Every verification claim must have fresh evidence. Run the command, read the output, THEN make the claim.

| Claim | Required | Not Sufficient |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| "Tests pass" | Test output: "X passed, 0 failed" | Previous run, "should pass" |
| "Lint clean" | Linter output: 0 errors | "I didn't change style" |
| "Build succeeds" | Build output: exit 0 | "Linter passed" |
| "Bug fixed" | Test original symptom: passes | "Code changed, assumed fixed" |

**Never use:** "should pass", "looks correct", "probably fine". If you haven't run the command in this step, you cannot claim the result.

---

## When to Stop

**Stop executing and escalate immediately when:**
- A dependency is missing or unavailable
- A test fails repeatedly after attempted fixes
- An instruction in the plan is unclear or contradictory
- Verification fails in a way you can't diagnose
- The plan itself appears to have a bug (e.g., task references a file that doesn't exist)

**Ask rather than guess.** A wrong guess costs more than a pause for clarification.

---

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

- Do NOT claim implementation is complete without running ALL verification steps
- Do NOT rely only on tests passing — manual verification is mandatory
- Do NOT skip Playwright MCP frontend testing when there are UI changes
- Do NOT deploy to the main Docker stack — use the worktree's isolated stack
- Do NOT leave discovered issues as "known gaps" — fix them and add tests
- Do NOT make one giant commit at the end — commit after each task
- Do NOT stop at the first passing test run — re-read the spec for completeness
