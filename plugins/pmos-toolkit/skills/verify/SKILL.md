description: Post-implementation verification gate — lint, test, deploy, spec compliance, multi-agent code review, manual QA, and regression test hardening. Run after implementation is done (whether via /execute, manual coding, or partial work). Works with git commits, no PR required. Use when the user says "check my work", "is this done", "verify the implementation", "did I miss anything", or "review and test everything".

# Implementation Verification Gate

Systematically verify that an implementation matches its spec, requirements, and plan. This is a **standalone verification gate** — run it anytime after implementation is done, regardless of how the code was written.

This is an **operational workflow** — a structured sequence of verification steps with evidence collection.

**Announce at start:** "Using the verify skill to run post-implementation verification."

## Platform Adaptation

These instructions use Claude Code tool names. In other environments:
- **No `AskUserQuestion`:** State your assumption, document it in the output, and proceed. The user reviews after completion.
- **No subagents:** Perform research and analysis sequentially as a single agent.
- **No Playwright MCP:** Note browser-based verification as a manual step for the user.

---

## When to Use

- After `/execute` completes (double-check)
- After manual implementation
- After picking up someone else's partial work
- Before claiming a feature is done
- When you suspect gaps between spec and implementation

---

## Phase 0: Gather Context

1. **Locate upstream documents.** Find the spec, requirements, and plan:
   - Check user argument first
   - Then search `docs/specs/`, `docs/requirements/`, `docs/plans/` for the most recent matching files
   - If nothing found, ask the user
2. **Read all three documents** (whichever exist). You need these for the compliance check.
3. **Identify what changed.** Run `git diff main...HEAD --stat` (or appropriate base) to see which files were modified. This scopes the verification.
4. **Check if lint/type/tests were already run.** Ask the user or check recent terminal history. Skip steps already completed — but re-run if you're not confident they were clean.

---

## Phase 1: Static Verification (fast, run first)

Run in this order. Each step must pass before proceeding to the next. If a step fails, fix the issue, then re-run.

### 1a. Lint & Format

```bash
ruff check . && ruff format --check .
```
(Or project-appropriate linter. Check `CLAUDE.md` for the correct commands.)

**If issues found:** Fix them. Re-run. Do not proceed until clean.

### 1b. Type Checks

```bash
# Python: pyright or mypy
# TypeScript: tsc --noEmit
# Frontend: npm run lint (if it includes type checking)
```

**If issues found:** Fix them. Re-run.

### 1c. Unit Tests

```bash
pytest tests/ -v  # or project-appropriate test command
```

**Evidence required:** Paste the summary line showing pass/fail counts. "X passed, 0 failed" is the minimum bar.

**If failures:** Fix them. Do NOT skip failing tests. Do NOT mark tests as `@pytest.mark.skip` to make the suite pass.

### 1d. Frontend Tests & Lint (if applicable)

```bash
cd apps/<frontend-app> && npm run lint && npm test
```

---

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent Code Quality Review

Dispatch parallel subagents to review the diff from multiple angles. This catches code quality issues that static analysis and tests miss. Works against `git diff` — no PR required.

### Setup

```bash
# Get the diff to review
git diff main...HEAD          # if on a feature branch
git diff HEAD~N               # if commits are on main (N = number of commits in this feature)
```

Identify all CLAUDE.md files relevant to the changed directories (root + any directory-level CLAUDE.md files).

### Parallel Review Agents (dispatch simultaneously)

Launch 3-5 subagents depending on the scope of changes:

| Agent | Focus | What to return |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| **CLAUDE.md compliance** | Read the diff + all relevant CLAUDE.md files. Flag any violations of project conventions, naming patterns, code style rules, or architectural constraints. | List of violations with file:line and the specific CLAUDE.md rule. |
| **Bug scan** | Read only the changed lines (shallow scan). Look for obvious bugs: off-by-one errors, null/undefined access, missing error handling at system boundaries, race conditions, resource leaks. Ignore style issues. | List of potential bugs with severity and reasoning. |
| **Git history context** | Run `git blame` and `git log` on modified files. Check if changes break assumptions from previous work — renamed functions still referenced elsewhere, removed code that other modules depend on, changed behavior that tests don't cover. | List of issues with historical context. |
| **Comment compliance** | Read code comments in modified files (TODOs, invariants, "do not change" warnings, API contracts documented in docstrings). Check if the changes violate any guidance in those comments. | List of violated comments with file:line. |
| **Cross-file consistency** | Check that changes are consistent across files — if a function signature changed, are all callers updated? If a type changed, are all usages updated? If a config key was renamed, is it renamed everywhere? | List of inconsistencies. |

### Confidence Scoring

For each issue found, score confidence (0-100):

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0-25 | Likely false positive — doesn't stand up to scrutiny, or pre-existing issue |
| 25-50 | Might be real but could be a nitpick. Not explicitly called out in CLAUDE.md. |
| 50-75 | Verified real issue but minor — won't happen often in practice |
| 75-100 | Verified real issue, will directly impact functionality, or explicitly violates CLAUDE.md |

**Filter:** Only act on issues scoring 75+. Log issues scoring 50-74 as "noted but not blocking." Discard below 50.

### Fix & Re-verify

For each issue scoring 75+:
1. Fix the issue
2. Re-run the relevant static verification step from Phase 1
3. If the fix changes behavior, add a regression test (Phase 5)

---

## Phase 3: Deploy & Integration Verification

### 3a. Database Migrations (if applicable)

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

Verify the migration applied cleanly. Check for errors in output.

### 3b. Docker Deployment

Deploy to the appropriate environment (main stack or worktree stack):

```bash
docker compose build <affected-services> && docker compose up -d <affected-services>
```

Wait for services to be healthy. Check logs for startup errors.

### 3c. API Smoke Tests

For every new or modified API endpoint, verify the response shape matches the spec:

```bash
curl -sf <endpoint> | python3 -m json.tool
```

**Evidence required:** Show the actual response and compare it to the spec's API contract. Flag any mismatches.

### 3d. Frontend Verification (Playwright MCP)

For every affected UI flow:

1. **Authenticate first** (if auth is enabled)
2. **Navigate** to each affected page
3. **Walk through** every user journey from the spec
4. **Check** for console errors/warnings
5. **Take screenshots** for evidence
6. **Verify** that UI matches spec's frontend design section

### 3e. Manual Spot Checks

Run actual scenarios in the development environment. Interact with the system as a user would. Specifically:

- Test the happy path end-to-end
- Test at least one error/edge case from the spec
- Test empty states if applicable
- Verify that unrelated flows still work (no regressions)

**Do NOT rely only on automated tests.** Manual verification catches issues that tests miss (rendering glitches, confusing UX, wrong copy, timing issues).

---

## Phase 4: Spec Compliance Check

This is the most important phase. Re-read each upstream document and verify every requirement is implemented.

### 4a. Requirements Compliance

Read `docs/requirements/<file>`. For every goal, user journey, and acceptance criterion:

| # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|---|-------------|--------|----------|
| Goal 1 | [From requirements] | Pass/Fail/Partial | [Test name, screenshot, or curl output] |
| Journey 1, Step 3 | [Specific step] | Pass/Fail | [How verified] |

### 4b. Spec Compliance

Read `docs/specs/<file>`. For every FR-ID and edge case:

| ID | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| FR-01 | [From spec] | Pass/Fail | [Test name or manual verification] |
| FR-02 | ... | ... | ... |
| E1 | [Edge case] | Pass/Fail | [How verified] |

### 4c. Plan Compliance

Read `docs/plans/<file>`. For every task:

| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| T1: [Name] | Complete/Partial/Missing | [Any issues] |
| T2: ... | ... | ... |

### 4d. Gap Report

List every gap found:

| # | Gap | Severity | Source Doc | Action |
|---|-----|----------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | [What's missing] | Critical/Medium/Low | [Which doc] | [Fix or defer] |

**If critical gaps exist:** Fix them before proceeding. Re-run affected verification steps.

---

## Phase 5: Harden the Test Suite

For every issue discovered during verification:

1. **Write a regression test** that would have caught the issue
2. **Verify red-green:** The test must fail when you revert the fix, and pass with the fix applied
3. **Name descriptively:** `test_<function>_<bug_condition>_<expected_outcome>`

This is not optional. The goal is that the same issue can never ship again.

Also check for coverage gaps:
- Any spec requirement with no corresponding test? Write one.
- Any edge case from the spec that isn't tested? Write one.
- Any user journey that's only verified manually? Consider adding an integration or E2E test.

---

## Phase 6: Final Compliance Pass

One last check before committing:

1. **Re-read the spec one final time.** Is there ANYTHING mentioned that isn't implemented or verified?
2. **Check for TODO/FIXME/HACK** in the changed files. Resolve them or flag them explicitly.
3. **Check for debug logging** or temporary code that should be removed.
4. **Check for hardcoded values** that should be configuration.
5. **Verify documentation is updated** (CLAUDE.md, changelogs, API docs).

---

## Phase 7: Commit & Report

1. **Commit all changes** (fixes, new tests, documentation updates):
   ```bash
   git add <specific-files>
   git commit -m "fix: verification fixes for <feature>"
   ```
   If there are multiple logical changes, use multiple commits.

2. **Report to the user:**
   - Verification summary (which phases passed/failed)
   - Compliance tables (requirements, spec FR-IDs, plan tasks)
   - Gaps found and how they were resolved
   - New tests added (count and what they cover)
   - Any remaining issues that need user decision

---

## Evidence Standards

Every claim must have evidence. No exceptions:

| Claim | Required Evidence |
|-------|------------------|
| "Tests pass" | Paste the actual output: "34 passed, 0 failed" |
| "Lint is clean" | Paste the actual output: no errors |
| "API returns correct shape" | Show the actual curl output |
| "UI renders correctly" | Screenshot via Playwright MCP |
| "Spec requirement met" | Point to specific test or manual verification |
| "No regressions" | Show full test suite output |

**Never use:** "should pass", "looks correct", "probably fine", "I believe"

---

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

- Do NOT skip manual verification — automated tests miss UX issues, rendering bugs, and timing problems
- Do NOT mark failing tests as skip to make the suite pass
- Do NOT claim "tests pass" without showing the output
- Do NOT skip the spec compliance check — this is the most valuable phase
- Do NOT leave discovered issues as "known gaps" — fix them and add regression tests
- Do NOT commit debug logging, TODOs, or temporary workarounds
- Do NOT verify only the happy path — test at least one error/edge case
- Do NOT assume the previous verification run is still valid — re-run after every fix
- Do NOT skip the hardening phase — converting bugs to tests is what prevents regressions
