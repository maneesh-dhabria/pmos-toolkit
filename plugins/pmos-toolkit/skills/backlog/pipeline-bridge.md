# Pipeline Bridge

Defines the `--backlog <id>` contract that the `/backlog` skill and the pipeline skills (`/requirements`, `/spec`, `/plan`, `/execute`, `/verify`) jointly implement.

## Principle

Pipeline skills mutate backlog item state ONLY when `--backlog <id>` is explicitly passed. Without it, the backlog is invisible to them. This is the consent gate that prevents surprise edits when a user runs a pipeline skill on something unrelated.

## Lifecycle

| Pipeline event | Item update | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `/requirements --backlog <id>` writes its doc | item `source:` set to the requirements doc path | The `/requirements` skill invokes Phase 6 (set) on `/backlog` after writing its output |
| `/spec --backlog <id>` writes its doc | item `spec_doc:` set; status: `inbox`/`ready` -> `spec'd`; `planned`+ unchanged | `/spec` invokes Phase 6 (set) twice (one for spec_doc, one for status if applicable) |
| `/plan --backlog <id>` writes its doc | item `plan_doc:` set; status -> `planned` | `/plan` invokes Phase 6 (set) |
| `/execute --backlog <id>` starts | status -> `in-progress` | `/execute` invokes Phase 6 (set) at the start of execution |
| `/verify --backlog <id>` reports pass | status -> `done`; `pr:` filled if available from git context | `/verify` invokes Phase 6 (set) |

## Auto-prompt (offered seeds)

When `/requirements` or `/spec` is invoked with an empty argument string AND `--backlog` is not provided AND a `<repo>/backlog/items/` directory exists:

1. Read items via Phase 11 if a workstream is linked, else local items only.
2. Filter to candidate statuses: `/requirements` -> `inbox` or `ready`; `/spec` -> `ready`.
3. Sort by priority bucket (must>should>could>maybe), then `score` desc, then `updated` desc.
4. Take the top 5.
5. Offer them via `AskUserQuestion`:
   ```
   No seed provided. Pick a backlog item to start from?

     1. #0042 [must, bug] SSL renewal cron is flaky
     2. #0017 [should, feature] Add OAuth support
     ...
     6. (skip — proceed with no seed)
   ```
6. If user picks one, set the seed to that item's content AND set `--backlog <id>` for the rest of the invocation.

This auto-prompt is a one-shot at the start of the skill; it does NOT recur.

## Auto-capture (deferred items flow into backlog)

`/plan` and `/verify` produce sections that surface deferred or out-of-scope work. Before those skills exit, they:

1. Detect candidate items in their output (heuristic: bulleted items under headings like "Deferred", "Out of scope", "Follow-up", "Future work", "Known limitations").
2. Construct a list of proposed backlog entries:
   - `title`: the bullet text (truncated to 100 chars)
   - `type`: inferred via `inference-heuristics.md`
   - `status`: `inbox`
   - `source`: the doc path being written
3. Show the proposed list to the user (`AskUserQuestion`):
   ```
   I detected 3 deferred items in this {plan|verify} output. Capture to backlog?

     1. Capture all
     2. Pick which to capture
     3. Skip
   ```
4. On confirm, invoke Phase 2 (`/backlog add ...`) for each, with the `source:` field pre-filled.

## Implementation pattern for pipeline skills

Each pipeline skill adds, near the top of its phase body, this Subroutine:

```markdown
### Subroutine: Backlog Bridge

If `--backlog <id>` was passed:
- After writing the primary output doc, invoke `/backlog set <id> {field}={value}` for the relevant field per the lifecycle table.
- If the set fails (item not found, etc.), emit a single-line warning and continue.

If `--backlog` was NOT passed AND argument is empty AND backlog/items/ exists:
- Run the auto-prompt flow above.

(For /plan and /verify) After the primary doc is written:
- Run the auto-capture flow above.
```

The skill body cites this reference document instead of restating the contract; only the per-field mapping changes per skill.
