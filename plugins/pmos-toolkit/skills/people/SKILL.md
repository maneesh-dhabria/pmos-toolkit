# People

A shared person/contact directory. Toolkit-wide entity store at `~/.pmos/people/`. Consumed by `/mytasks` (and future people-aware skills — 1:1 notes, meeting prep, stakeholder tracking).

**Announce at start:** "Using the people skill to {list|add|find|show|...}."

## Platform Adaptation

These instructions use Claude Code tool names. In other environments:
- **No `AskUserQuestion`:** follow `_shared/interactive-prompts.md` fallback path — one question at a time as plain text with numbered responses.
- **No subagents:** sequential single-agent operation.

## References

- `schema.md` — record file shape, enum values, `INDEX.md` format
- `lookup.md` — fuzzy-match algorithm, handle derivation rules
- `_shared/interactive-prompts.md` — interactive prompting protocol

## Phase 0: Subcommand Routing

Parse the user's argument to determine the subcommand.

| Argument shape | Subcommand |
|---|---|
| empty | Phase 1 (show INDEX.md) |
| `add <name>` | Phase 3 (proactive create — interactive) |
| `list [flags]` | Phase 5 (filtered list) |
| `show <handle-or-name>` | Phase 4 (render record) |
| `find <text>` | Phase 2 (fuzzy-match lookup) |
| `set <handle> <field>=<value>` | Phase 6 (single-field edit) |
| `refine <handle>` | Phase 7 (interactive multi-field refine) |
| `rebuild-index` | Phase 8 (regenerate INDEX.md) |

Unknown verbs error: `Unknown subcommand '{verb}'. Run /people for the default list, or see argument hint for valid forms.`

---

## Phase 1: Show INDEX

Triggered by `/people` with no arguments.

### Step 1: Resolve `~/.pmos/people/`

If `~/.pmos/people/INDEX.md` does not exist (or `~/.pmos/people/` is missing entirely), output:

`No people yet. Add a person with /people add <name>.`

Then exit.

### Step 2: Validate freshness

Compare `INDEX.md`'s `Last regenerated:` date against the most recent mtime of any `~/.pmos/people/*.md` (excluding `INDEX.md` itself). If any record is more recent, regenerate INDEX.md (apply Phase 8) before rendering.

### Step 3: Render

Output the contents of `~/.pmos/people/INDEX.md` to the user.

---

## Phase 8: Rebuild Index

Triggered by `/people rebuild-index`. Also invoked internally by Phases 3, 6, 7 after any write.

### Step 1: Read records

Glob `~/.pmos/people/*.md` (excluding `INDEX.md`). For each, parse frontmatter. Skip files with malformed frontmatter (emit a one-line warning per skip; do not abort).

### Step 2: Sort

Sort by `name` ascending (case-insensitive).

### Step 3: Write INDEX.md

Overwrite `~/.pmos/people/INDEX.md` with the format defined in `schema.md` (### INDEX.md format section):

```markdown
# People

Last regenerated: {today ISO date}

| handle | name | designation | role | working_relationship | team | email |
|--------|------|-------------|------|----------------------|------|-------|
| {handle} | {name} | {designation or empty} | {role or empty} | {working_relationship or empty} | {team or empty} | {email or empty} |
```

Empty optional fields render as empty cells (no `null`, no dashes).

### Step 4: Report

If invoked directly (Phase 8 entered as `rebuild-index`): `Regenerated INDEX.md: {count} people.`
If invoked from another phase: silent on success, warn on failure.

---

## Phase 2: Fuzzy-Match Find

Triggered by `/people find <text>`. Read-only lookup. Used by `/mytasks` capture and by users directly.

Algorithm and tier definitions: see `lookup.md`.

### Step 1: Resolve and read

If `~/.pmos/people/` does not exist or contains no records, output: `No people in directory. Add one with /people add <name>.` Exit.

Otherwise, glob `~/.pmos/people/*.md` (excluding `INDEX.md`). Parse frontmatter for each. Skip malformed files with a one-line warning.

### Step 2: Match in priority order

Apply the 5-tier match algorithm from `lookup.md`. Stop at the first tier that produces matches; do not collect from lower tiers if a higher tier hit.

For each record, evaluate match tiers in order:
1. Exact handle (case-insensitive on `handle:`).
2. Exact alias (case-insensitive on any entry in `aliases:`).
3. Exact name (case-insensitive on `name:`).
4. Substring on handle / name / aliases.
5. Initials of `name:` (only if input length ≤ 3 AND input is all letters).

Within the matching tier, sort by `updated:` desc; break ties alphabetically by handle.

### Step 3: Render

- **0 matches:** `No matches for '{input}'.`
- **1 match:** `1 match: {handle} ({name}){match-note}.`
  - `{match-note}` is empty for tier 1, ` — matched alias '{alias}'` for tier 2, omitted for tier 3, ` — substring match` for tier 4, ` — initials match` for tier 5.
- **N matches:**
  ```
  {N} matches:
    {handle} ({name}){match-note}
    ...
  ```

### Step 4: Caller integration

When `find` is invoked programmatically by `/mytasks` (not a user-typed command), the caller reads the rendered output and parses out handles. The output format above is contract — do not change without updating callers.

---

## Phase 3: Proactive Create (`add`)

Triggered by `/people add <name>`. Interactive — collects rich attributes upfront.

### Step 1: Derive handle

Apply the handle derivation rules from `lookup.md` against the provided `<name>`:
1. Tokenize on whitespace, lowercase, drop pure-punctuation tokens.
2. Single-token name: try `<firstname>`, then `<firstname>-2`, etc.
3. Multi-token name: try `<firstname>-<lastinitial>`, then `<firstname>-<lastname>`, then `<firstname>-<lastname>-N`.

A "collision" means a file with that handle already exists at `~/.pmos/people/{handle}.md`.

### Step 2: Collect attributes via `_shared/interactive-prompts.md`

Ask in this order, ONE field at a time per the shared protocol:

1. **`designation`** — free string. Prompt: `Designation? (formal title, e.g., 'VP Engineering')`. Skippable.
2. **`role`** — free string. Prompt: `Role? (informal day-to-day, e.g., 'Eng Manager')`. Skippable.
3. **`working_relationship`** — enum. Prompt: `Working relationship?` Options: `boss`, `direct-report`, `peer`, `team-member`, `stakeholder`, `external`, `other`. Skippable (no default).
4. **`team`** — free string. Prompt: `Team?`. Skippable.
5. **`email`** — free string. Prompt: `Email?`. Skippable.
6. **`workstreams`** — comma-separated list. Prompt: `Workstreams? (comma-separated slugs from ~/.pmos/workstreams/)`. Skippable.
7. **`aliases`** — comma-separated list. Prompt: `Aliases? (comma-separated short forms for fuzzy match)`. Skippable.

### Step 3: Write the record file

Path: `~/.pmos/people/{handle}.md`.

Frontmatter (skipped fields are written as bare keys with no value, e.g., `email:` not absent):

```yaml
---
handle: {derived-handle}
name: {original name argument}
designation: {value or empty}
role: {value or empty}
working_relationship: {value or empty}
team: {value or empty}
email: {value or empty}
workstreams: [{values}]   # written as YAML list, even if single item; empty list as []
aliases: [{values}]
created: {today}
updated: {today}
---
```

No body section is auto-written. The user can add `## Notes` later via direct file edit or via `/people refine`.

### Step 4: Regenerate INDEX

Apply Phase 8 (rebuild-index) inline. If regeneration fails, the record file is still written — emit a warning suggesting `/people rebuild-index`, but DO NOT roll back the record write.

### Step 5: Report

Output: `Added {handle} ({name}).`

### Reactive create entry point (called by `/mytasks`, not user-invoked)

When `/mytasks` rich-capture hits an unknown person and the user picks "(a) create new person 'X'", `/mytasks` invokes a minimal create variant of this phase that:
- Skips Step 2 (no prompts).
- Sets `name:` to the disambiguated name.
- Sets `aliases:` to `[<original-token>]` (e.g., `[sarah]` if the user wrote `@sarah`).
- All other fields absent.
- Returns the derived handle to the caller.

This entry point has no user-facing slash command — `/mytasks` invokes it directly via shared instruction reference.

(Phases 4, 5, 6, 7 are added in subsequent tasks.)
