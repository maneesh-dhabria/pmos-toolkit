description: Pressure-test a spec against realistic and adversarial scenarios before implementation — scenario trace, artifact fitness critique, interface cross-reference, targeted pseudocode. Optional validator between /spec and /plan in the requirements -> spec -> plan pipeline. Use when the user says "simulate the design", "validate this spec", "will this design actually work", "check for gaps in the design", or has a spec ready for end-to-end scrutiny before implementation.

# Spec Simulation Generator

Pressure-test a technical spec by walking realistic and adversarial scenarios through it, critiquing each artifact for fitness, cross-referencing interface and core, and producing a standalone simulation doc whose Gap Register drives coordinated spec patches. The output is both a quality gate and a durable "why we believe this design works" artifact.

This is an OPTIONAL VALIDATOR in the pipeline — runs between `/spec` and `/plan`:

```
/requirements  →  [/msf, /creativity]  →  /spec  →  [/simulate-spec]  →  /plan  →  /execute  →  /verify
                   optional enhancers              (this skill)
                                                  optional validator
```

**Announce at start:** "Using the simulate-spec skill to pressure-test the design."

## Platform Adaptation

These instructions use Claude Code tool names. In other environments:
- **No `AskUserQuestion`:** State your assumption, document it in the output, and proceed. The user reviews after completion.
- **No subagents:** Perform research and analysis sequentially as a single agent.
- **No Playwright MCP:** Note browser-based verification as a manual step for the user.

## Track Progress

This skill has multiple phases. Create one task per phase using your agent's task-tracking tool (e.g., `TodoWrite` in Claude Code, equivalent in other agents). Mark each task in-progress when you start it and completed as soon as it finishes — do not batch completions.

## Load Learnings

Read `~/.pmos/learnings.md` if it exists. Note any entries under `## /simulate-spec` and factor them into your approach for this session.

## Locate Spec

Follow `../.shared/resolve-input.md` with `phase=specs`, `label="spec"`. Read the resolved file end-to-end before Phase 1.

---

## Phase 0: Load Workstream Context

Before any other work, follow the context loading instructions in `product-context/context-loading.md` (relative to the skills directory). This determines `{docs_path}` and loads workstream context if available. Use workstream context to inform critique — product constraints and tech-stack decisions shape what counts as a gap. Also note any entries under `## /simulate-spec` in `~/.pmos/learnings.md` and factor them into your approach for this session.

---

## Phase 1: Intake, Tier Detection & Scope Declaration

### 1.1 Locate the spec
Follow `../.shared/resolve-input.md` with `phase=specs`, `label="spec"`. Echo the resolved path before proceeding.

### 1.2 Read the spec end-to-end
Read the full file. Summarize back to the user in 3-5 bullets covering: problem, primary goals, tier, decisions already made. Confirm understanding via AskUserQuestion (or state assumption per Platform Adaptation if AskUserQuestion is unavailable).

### 1.3 Check for existing simulation
Look in `{docs_path}/simulations/` for an existing file covering this feature.
- **If found:** ask "Is this an update to the existing simulation, or a fresh start?" Update mode re-traces only against changed spec sections; fresh start re-runs all phases.
- **If not found:** proceed.

### 1.4 Detect tier from spec header

| Tier | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| **Tier 1** (bug fix) | Skill refuses to run. Announce: "This is a Tier 1 spec — simulation is overkill. Skipping." Then exit. |
| **Tier 2** (enhancement) | All phases run. Inline gap resolution (one gap at a time in Phase 7). 1 review loop. |
| **Tier 3** (feature / new system) | All phases run. Batched gap resolution (by category in Phase 7). 1 review loop. Deeper adversarial coverage in Phase 2. |

The tier is declared in the spec header (e.g., `**Tier:** 2`). If absent, infer from scope (single bug → Tier 1; behavior enhancement → Tier 2; new capability or major redesign → Tier 3) and announce the inferred tier for confirmation.

### 1.5 Scope Declaration

Auto-detect the layers present in the spec by scanning section headers (DB Schema, API Contracts, Frontend Design, CLI, Events, Infrastructure, etc.). Combine with the spec's Non-Goals section. Then ask the user via AskUserQuestion:

> "Scope check:
> - **In this spec:** [auto-detected layers]
> - **Out of scope** (deferred to separate spec or later phase)?
> - **Companion specs** (e.g., backend-spec.md and frontend-spec.md)? Paths if any.
> - **Downstream consumers we should anticipate** (e.g., 'web UI in Phase 2')?"

Record the answers. The scope drives everything downstream:
- **Out-of-scope layers** → their critique buckets in Phase 4 are SKIPPED, not flagged as gaps
- **Companion specs** → cross-referenced during Phase 5 wire-up (read the companion, do the cross-reference table against it)
- **Anticipated consumers** → produce **forward-compat notes** rather than gaps — soft flags like "API response lacks `discount_breakdown` — fine today but likely needed when the visual UI lands"

### 1.6 Record scope

Hold scope state in memory; it gets written into Phase 8's simulation doc Section 1 (Scope).

**Gate:** Do not proceed to Phase 2 until tier is confirmed and scope is declared.

## Phase 2: Scenario Enumeration

Generate the full scenario list in four passes, then confirm with the user before tracing. The point of simulation is to find gaps the spec MISSED — trusting only the spec's stated scenarios defeats the purpose.

### 2a. Extract from spec
Each User Journey and each Edge Case in the spec becomes a numbered scenario (S1, S2, ...). Keep the spec's wording where possible.

### 2b. Generate missing happy-path variants
Look for variants the spec didn't enumerate:
- Different personas (first-time user, power user, admin, support agent)
- Different entry points (deep link, mobile, API direct, CLI)
- Different starting states (empty data, near-quota, post-error recovery)

Add each as a new numbered scenario.

### 2c. Adversarial checklist
For each of these 10 categories, name 1-3 concrete scenarios where applicable to this spec. SKIP categories that don't apply — but state which you skipped and why.

1. **Service/dependency down** — what if a downstream service is unreachable mid-flow?
2. **Concurrent writes** — same resource by same user; same resource by two users; rapid retries
3. **Partial failures** — step N of M fails; some side effects committed, others not
4. **Retries & idempotency** — retry fires after the original eventually succeeded; double-submit
5. **Stale data / cache invalidation** — user sees old data; cache TTL boundary; stale read after write
6. **Permission/auth edge cases** — token expires mid-flow; role downgraded mid-flow; cross-tenant access attempt
7. **Data size / pagination limits** — empty result; result at boundary (page size − 1, page size, page size + 1); 10x expected size
8. **Network partition / timeout** — request sent but response lost; long-running operation timeout
9. **Ordering** — out-of-order event delivery; late-arriving data; clock skew between services
10. **Empty / null / malformed inputs** — required field missing; whitespace-only; UTF-8 edge characters; max-length boundary

### 2d. Model-driven pass
Read the spec critically — what could break that's specific to THIS design and not captured above? Name 3-5 design-specific failure modes. Examples of the shape of question to ask:
- "What if the deduplication window is shorter than the retry window?"
- "What if the spec's batch-size assumption breaks at scale?"
- "What if two flows that share a state column get into a race?"

### Consolidated scenario list

Present the full list as a table:

| # | Scenario | Source | Category |
|---|----------|--------|----------|
| S1 | Customer places order with valid promo | Spec §5.2 | happy |
| S14 | Two customers apply last-remaining promo simultaneously | Adversarial | concurrency |
| S22 | Webhook retry fires after the original succeeded | Adversarial | retry |
| S27 | Promo expires while order is still in cart (5+ min) | Model-driven | timing |

**Source values:** `Spec §X.Y`, `Variant`, `Adversarial`, `Model-driven`.
**Category values:** `happy`, `edge`, `concurrency`, `failure`, `retry`, `timing`, `auth`, `boundary`, `ordering`, `input` (or other category names that fit).

**Gate:** Present consolidated scenario list. Ask "Here are N scenarios. Any missing? Any to remove?" Wait for user confirmation (or stated assumption per Platform Adaptation) before Phase 3.

## Phase 3: Scenario Trace

For each confirmed scenario, decompose into the steps the design must perform end-to-end. For each step, cite the concrete spec artifact that implements it (FR-ID, API endpoint, DB column, sequence diagram, state transition, sequence step). If no artifact exists for a step, flag as **GAP** and append to the Gap Register.

**Coverage matrix format:**

| Scenario | Step | Spec Artifact | Status |
|----------|------|---------------|--------|
| S14: Concurrent promo apply | 1. Customer A sends POST /orders/{id}/promo | API §9.3 | ✓ |
| | 2. Check promo availability | No `promo_usage` table with unique constraint | **GAP** |
| | 3. Decrement promo counter | Not specified | **GAP** |
| | 4. Return success | API §9.3 response | ✓ |

**Gap Register:** A running list of all findings from Phases 3-6. Each entry: `{# | Gap | Exposed By | Severity | Disposition}`. Severity is one of:
- **blocker** — design will not work without this
- **significant** — design works but produces wrong outcomes in the named scenario
- **minor** — quality-of-life issue, not blocking
- **forward-compat** — fine today; needed for declared future consumers

Disposition is filled in Phase 7. The Gap Register persists across Phases 3-6 — every phase appends to it.

**Tip:** When a step has multiple plausible artifacts, cite all of them. Ambiguity itself is a finding worth logging as "minor — multiple valid interpretations."

---

## Phase 4: Artifact Fitness Critique

Walk each spec artifact bucket and ask not "is this present?" but "is this RIGHT for the scenarios?" Findings get appended to the Gap Register with severity labels.

Run the buckets that apply based on the Scope Declaration from Phase 1. Skip buckets explicitly out of scope.

### Bucket 1: Data & Storage

For each table / collection / persistent store in the spec:
- **Schema shape** — does it have the columns the scenarios need? Right cardinality (single vs. list)?
- **Relationships** — foreign keys present? Cardinality correct (1:1 vs. 1:N vs. N:N)?
- **Constraints** — UNIQUE on what should be unique? NOT NULL on what shouldn't be null? CHECK constraints for state machines?
- **Indexes** — do the actual query patterns from the scenarios have supporting indexes? Composite index column order match query predicates?
- **Lifecycle columns** — `created_at`, `updated_at`, soft-delete (`deleted_at`), version (`version` for optimistic locking)?
- **Temporal / audit needs** — do scenarios require historical state? Audit log table?
- **Idempotency** — `idempotency_key` column on tables that receive retried writes?
- **Optimistic locking / versioning** — concurrency-sensitive tables have a version column?
- **Config & feature flags** — runtime configurable values captured? Default values documented?

### Bucket 2: Service Interfaces

For each API endpoint, message, event, webhook, or integration contract:
- **Request payload completeness** — every field the handler needs is in the request?
- **Response payload usefulness** — consumer needs (not just "return the entity")? Will consumers need a follow-up call to get related data?
- **Error responses** — enumerated with shape (not just status codes)? Each plausible failure has a defined error shape?
- **Pagination, filtering, sorting** — present where collection size warrants?
- **Idempotency keys** — required on mutating endpoints that are retry-prone?
- **Versioning strategy** — clear path for backward-compatible evolution?
- **Events / messages / webhooks** — payload shape stable? Replay-safe? Ordering guarantees stated?

### Bucket 3: Behavior (State / Workflows)

For each state machine, workflow, or multi-step process:
- **All states present** — including failed, cancelled, terminal/archived? Partial-success states?
- **Every transition defined** — including reverse transitions (rollback, cancel) and self-loops (retry)?
- **Dead states** — flagged any state with no way out?
- **Side effects per transition** — named explicitly (event emitted, notification sent, downstream call triggered)?

### Bucket 4: Interface (adaptive — only one variant runs based on Scope Declaration)

**If UI is in scope:**
- Component hierarchy — right boundaries, right ownership of state?
- State placement — URL / store / server / component — sensible?
- All UI states covered — loading, empty, error, partial-load, stale, auth-expired-mid-flow?
- First-time vs. returning user, form validation, navigation, deep-linking, back-button behavior?
- Optimistic updates + rollback behavior on API failure?
- Accessibility (keyboard nav, screen reader, ARIA), responsive breakpoints?

**If CLI is in scope:**
- Arguments, flags, output format, exit codes?
- `--help` complete and accurate?
- Piping/composability — output usable as input to next command?
- Idempotency, `--dry-run`, logging verbosity flags?
- Error messages actionable (tell user what to do)?

**If Library only:**
- Public API ergonomics — naming, return shapes, error types?
- Pagination patterns (iterators vs. cursors vs. callback)?
- Sync vs. async clearly delineated?

**If no interface declared:** skip Bucket 4.

### Bucket 5: Wire-up

Handled in Phase 5 (Interface ↔ Core Cross-Reference). No critique here — the cross-reference table IS the critique.

### Bucket 6: Operational

- **NFR specificity** — performance targets numeric and measurable? Accessibility requirements concrete (WCAG level)? Security posture (authn, authz, data classification, encryption at rest/transit)?
- **Observability** — logs (what events, what fields), metrics (what counters/histograms, what dimensions), traces (what spans, what attributes)?
- **Rollout** — feature flags for risky paths? Migration order documented? Rollback plan concrete? Graceful degradation when downstream is unavailable?
- **Architecture diagram** — external dependencies named with their versions/SLAs? Data flow directions clear? Ownership boundaries match team boundaries?

### Extensibility clause

Scan the spec for any artifact types not covered above (CLI definitions, cron schedules, IaC resources, ML training loops, message broker topics, etc.). For each, apply the same "is this right, or just present?" critique using the patterns from the buckets above as a starting point.

## Phase 5: Interface ↔ Core Cross-Reference

Required when the spec has an interface in scope. Skip if Scope Declaration set "no interface" (pure service / library-only).

**Interface-type → table format:**

| Interface in scope | Cross-reference table |
|--------------------|----------------------|
| Frontend (UI) | UI interaction ↔ API endpoint |
| CLI | CLI command ↔ API/function |
| External service / webhook | Caller ↔ endpoint |
| Library-only | Public function ↔ internal logic |
| None declared | Skip Phase 5 |

**Standard column set:**

| # | Interaction | Trigger | Endpoint/Function | Req Shape Match | Res Has What Consumer Needs | Error Mapping Defined | Notes |
|---|-------------|---------|-------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|----------------------|-------|
| W1 | Click "Apply promo" | `<PromoInput>` component | POST /orders/{id}/promo | ✓ | ✗ missing `discount_breakdown` | partial — no "expired" UI msg | Wire-up gap W1 (significant) |
| W2 | Submit checkout | `<CheckoutForm>` | POST /orders | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | clean |

**Reverse scan** (do this AFTER the forward table):
- Every endpoint defined in the spec's API section → does it have a consumer in the interface (or is it explicitly flagged as internal/admin/cron-only)?
- Every mutating action in the interface → does it map to a defined endpoint?

**Orphans become gaps:**
- Endpoint with no consumer → either gap (forgotten consumer) or doc gap (missing "internal" tag)
- Interface action with no endpoint → blocker gap

Append all wire-up findings to the Gap Register with `W` prefix (W1, W2, ...) to distinguish from scenario gaps (S-prefix) and fitness gaps (B-prefix for bucket).

If a companion spec was provided in Scope Declaration (Phase 1), read it now and complete the cross-reference against it (e.g., backend-spec defines POST /orders; frontend-spec calls it from `<CheckoutForm>` — verify the contract holds across the seam).
