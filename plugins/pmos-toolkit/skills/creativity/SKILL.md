description: Apply structured creativity techniques to requirements and proposed solutions — generate non-obvious improvement ideas across user journeys. Optional enhancer for Tier 3 requirements — apply before /spec. Use when the user says "what are we missing", "think outside the box", "alternative approaches", "can we be more creative", or wants non-obvious ideas for improving the proposed solution.

# Creativity Analysis

Evaluate requirements and proposed solutions through structured creativity techniques to generate non-obvious improvement ideas. Quality over quantity — each technique should produce 0 or 1 strong idea per journey. Don't pad.

Best applied to **Tier 3 requirements** (features / product launches) after `/requirements` and before `/spec`. Can be combined with `/msf`.

```
/requirements  →  [/msf, /creativity]  →  /spec  →  /plan  →  /execute  →  /verify
                         (this skill) ↑
```

**Announce at start:** "Using the creativity skill to evaluate improvement ideas for the requirements."

## Platform Adaptation

These instructions use Claude Code tool names. In other environments:
- **No `AskUserQuestion`:** State your assumption, document it in the output, and proceed. The user reviews after completion.
- **No subagents:** Perform research and analysis sequentially as a single agent.
- **No Playwright MCP:** Note browser-based verification as a manual step for the user.

---

## Phase 1: Identify & Align on Personas

Propose user personas (minimum 2, maximum 5) and typical usage scenarios (maximum 2 per persona — these are usage contexts, not error cases).

**Priority guidance:** Focus depth on **new users** and **power users**. Go lighter on others.

Present via AskUserQuestion for approval before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2: Identify & Confirm Journeys

List the key user journeys from the requirements that should be analyzed. Confirm the list with the user via AskUserQuestion before proceeding.

---

## Phase 3: Analyze

Use subagents to analyze each journey from the approved personas and scenarios. For each journey, apply each creativity technique and generate improvement ideas.

**Quality over coverage:** Each technique should produce 0 or 1 idea per journey. Skip freely if nothing strong — don't pad.

### Creativity Techniques

**Tier 1 — Prioritize (spend more thought here):**

| Technique | Prompt |
|-----------|--------|
| **Remove friction** | What steps, clicks, decisions, or waits can be eliminated entirely? |
| **Reduce anxiety** | Where does the user feel uncertain, exposed, or at risk? How can we reassure them? |
| **Solve an unexpressed but real need** | What does the user actually want but hasn't articulated — or doesn't know they want? |
| **Reframe** | What if we redefine the problem? What if the constraint we assumed isn't actually a constraint? |
| **Make it unnecessary** | What if the user didn't need to do this step at all? Can the system do it for them? |
| **Do the opposite** | What if we reversed the expected flow, the default, or the convention? |

**Tier 2 — Apply but don't force:**

| Technique | Prompt |
|-----------|--------|
| **Add constraints** | What if we restricted options to simplify the experience? |
| **Remove constraints** | What if we removed a limit that seemed necessary? |
| **Combine 2 unrelated things** | What if we merged this with something from a different domain? |
| **Solve multiple problems at once** | Can one change address several pain points simultaneously? |
| **Make it much bigger** | What if this was 10x the scope — what would we do differently? |
| **Make it much smaller** | What's the absolute smallest version that still delivers value? |
| **Make it the only thing** | What if this was the ONLY feature — how would we make it perfect? |
| **Add friction** | Where would deliberate friction improve outcomes (e.g., confirmation, cooling-off)? |
| **Make them feel better & smarter** | How can we make the user feel competent, capable, and good about themselves? |
| **Build distribution within** | How can the product spread through its own use? |
| **Surprise** | Where can we exceed expectations in a delightful, unexpected way? |
| **Bundle** | What complementary experiences could we combine? |
| **Unbundle** | What should be separated into its own focused experience? |
| **Make it skeuomorphic** | What real-world analog could we mirror to make this instantly familiar? |

### Parallelization

If there are multiple flows and screens, analyze each independently using subagents. Capture analysis at both journey level and aggregate level. Serialize edits to any shared file — do not have multiple agents edit the same file concurrently.

### Save Analysis

Save consolidated findings to `docs/creativity/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>-creativity-analysis.md`. Commit.

**Report format:** Table-heavy, minimal prose. Keep the report under 300 lines.

Per-journey output table:

| Technique | Idea | Affected Journey/Screen | Effort | Priority |
|-----------|------|------------------------|--------|----------|

## Phase 4: Prioritize & Agree on Recommendations

Present recommendations individually for accept/reject via multi-select (not group-level accept/reject). Group by priority:
- **Must** — High-impact ideas that fundamentally improve the experience
- **Should** — Strong improvements worth the effort
- **Nice-to-Have** — Polish and delight items

Each recommendation must include:
- Severity (Must / Should / Nice-to-Have)
- Affected screens/journeys
- Implementation effort (Low / Medium / High)

**Dropped items stay in the analysis doc as ~~strikethrough~~ with "DROPPED" label**, for future reconsideration. Capture both agreed and dropped recommendations.

---

## Phase 5: Check Scope of Changes

Ask the user whether to update:
- (a) The requirements doc
- (b) Wireframes
- (c) Both

Only proceed with what the user approves.

**Wireframe guidance:** Update only `-final.html` wireframes (not iterations). Add visual elements for layout-affecting changes. Copy/label changes can be text annotations only.

---

## Phase 6: Consistency Pass

After any updates, run a final check:

1. Cross-reference every agreed recommendation against the revised requirements to confirm it was applied
2. Check for contradictions between sections
3. Verify wireframes match updated requirements text (if wireframes were updated)

Report any discrepancies found.

---

## Anti-Patterns (DO NOT)

- Do NOT skip persona alignment — creativity without user context produces generic ideas
- Do NOT force ideas from every technique — 0 ideas from a technique is fine
- Do NOT present a wall of ideas — group by priority, present individually for accept/reject
- Do NOT modify requirements or wireframes without user approval in Phase 5
- Do NOT spend equal time on all techniques — Tier 1 gets deep thought, Tier 2 gets a quick pass
- Do NOT remove dropped items from the doc — strikethrough with DROPPED label preserves them for future reconsideration
